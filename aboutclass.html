    <h1>About The Class</h1>
    <p>Each class is a 1-2 hour online Zoom session with primary focus on the 
        goals and objectives of the student. There are three formats that 
        classes can take:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structured</b>, following our online curriculum with focused training in
             forms and kicking techniques</li>
        <li><b>Flexible</b>, with the student specifying areas of improvement during 
            the class to work on throughout the session</li>
        <li><b>Dialogue</b>, with the student conversing with the instructor for 
            coaching or advice. This class does not involve active Taekwondo 
            training during the class, but serves as a means to help the 
            student identify their current skills, goals, and motivations in 
            Taekwondo. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Classes are scheduled ahead of time, based on availability for the
        student and the instructor. Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours
        prior to the lesson. 
    </p>
    <p> The student is responsible for finding an adequate space to train
        safely. A flat 3x3 meter space with no obstacles or obstructions is 
        recommended for active Taekwondo training. Resistance bands, dumbbells,
        or additional training tools are ideal for more advanced training, but 
        not required.
    </p>
